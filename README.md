#Contributions
 
<p>Ng Ruixin: This was first hackathon. Before this, she had never touched the MEAN stack. Helped write the angular and node functions for the date search function. Wrote the angular factory and controllers for the create function. Helped write the the angular factory function, angular controller function for the create post function. Wrote the entire angular factory function, angular controller function, server controller function and front end for the show post function. Wrote the entire angular factory function, angular controller function, configured html to angular partial and helped write the server controller function for the search listings function. Helped newer members with the front end. Contributed 60% of the backend</p>

<p>Mitchell Lee: Helped write the angular and node functions for the date search function. Wrote the server controller function and converted html into angular partial for the create function . Helped write the the angular factory function, angular controller function for the create post function. Helped write the server controller function for the get listings function. Set up the database models. Deployed the app on amazon AWS server. Helped newer members with the front end. Contributed 40% of the backend</p>

<p>Charles Berlin: This was his first time at a hackathon and had never touched html or css before. He did the front end for the search page. Helped with the create post page. Helped add css to the log in page. Made of use of more advanced html and css concepts such as percentage margins, opacity values and flex box. This is impressive considering it was his first time using html</p>

#Disclaimer
<p>Both Sally Bishop and Charles Berlin do not have commit histories on this project because there html code was modified to be angular partials and commited by other members.</p>

#Conclusion
<p> while this app might be small in scale, it was an impressive feat of team work. 3 out of 4 of our members had never been to a hackathon before and two members did not know anything about web development (front end or backend). Yet, we were able deploy a full web app complete with front end frame work (angular) and database (MongoDB) on an amazon W2 server within 36 hours. Sally Bishop and Charles Berlin, who had never learned html before, wrote beautiful web pages that incorporated concepts such as percentage values, opacity values and flex box that are usually used by more advanced front end developers. Ruixin Ng who had never worked with the MEAN stack, quickly learned how to write full angular controllers and factories as well as write a node js functions to query a MongoDB database.</p>
